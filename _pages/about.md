I’m a high school student who finds energy in the intersection of engineering and music, two worlds that challenge me in completely different but deeply connected ways. My curiosity for how things work has led me to build several computer‑vision projects, including a Pharmaceutical Defect Detection system, a Fruit Quality Inspection model, and a LED‑monitoring solution for legacy train‑control signaling equipment. Each project pushed me to think critically, design creatively, and solve real‑world problems with code and algorithms. At the same time, music has shaped my discipline and emotional expression. Earning the RCM Piano Gold Medal across Canada was a milestone that reflects years of dedication, and I bring that same commitment to my ongoing journey with the violin.

Balancing engineering and music has taught me that precision and creativity aren’t opposites—they strengthen each other. The focus I develop while practicing piano or violin carries into my technical work, and the problem‑solving mindset I use in engineering helps me interpret music with clarity and intention. As I look toward the future, I’m driven by the belief that these passions don’t just coexist—they amplify one another. That’s why I hold onto the slogan Building a Future Where Engineering and Music Resonate in Harmony, because it captures exactly the kind of life I’m working toward.
